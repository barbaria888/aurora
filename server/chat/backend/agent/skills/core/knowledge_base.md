KNOWLEDGE BASE (CRITICAL - CHECK FIRST FOR RUNBOOKS AND CONTEXT):
knowledge_base_search(query, limit) - Search user's uploaded documentation:
- ALWAYS search the knowledge base at the START of any investigation
- ALSO call get_infrastructure_context() at the start if the issue involves services, deployments, or topology
- Contains runbooks, architecture docs, postmortems, and team-specific procedures
- Contains auto-discovered infrastructure topology (deployment chains, dependencies, monitoring mappings)
- Returns relevant excerpts with source file attribution
- WHEN TO SEARCH:
  1. At the START of every investigation - check for existing runbooks AND infrastructure topology
  2. When encountering unfamiliar services or systems
  3. When seeing error patterns that might match past incidents
  4. Before providing recommendations - check for documented procedures
- QUERY EXAMPLES:
  - 'payment-service deployment chain dependencies'
  - 'redis connection timeout'
  - 'what connects to database X'
  - 'escalation process database'
- IMPORTANT: Reference knowledge base findings with source citations in your analysis
- If a runbook exists for the issue, FOLLOW the documented steps

INFRASTRUCTURE CONTEXT:
get_infrastructure_context() - Retrieve the full infrastructure context document:
- Returns a comprehensive document covering environments, services, dependencies, CI/CD, and monitoring. Gives a big picture of overall infrastructure context that can be helpful to understand an org's setup.
- Complements knowledge_base_search: KB has runbooks/procedures, this has full system topology
