"""Celery dispatcher for incoming GitHub App webhook deliveries.

Wave 2 (Task 11) shipped the dispatcher stub. Wave 3 (Task 13) wires the
``installation`` and ``installation_repositories`` state-sync handlers.
Wave 3 (Task 14) wires the code-event handlers (``pull_request``,
``issues``, ``deployment``, ``deployment_status``, ``workflow_run``,
``check_run``, ``check_suite``).

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Excluded by design (per plan): ``push``, ``release`` — the Aurora
GitHub App is NOT subscribed to these events; they should never reach
the dispatcher. If they do, they fall through the unknown-event path.

Per-event payload field schemas (cross-reference with GitHub docs):
- ``pull_request``  : repo, pr_number, action, state, merged_at,
                      head_sha, base_sha, author, title
- ``issues``        : repo, issue_number, action, state, author, title
- ``deployment``    : repo, deployment_id, environment, ref, sha, creator
- ``deployment_status``: repo, deployment_id, state, environment,
                         target_url, creator
- ``workflow_run``  : repo, workflow_run_id, name, conclusion, head_sha,
                      head_branch, run_attempt
- ``check_run``     : repo, check_id, name, status, conclusion, head_sha
- ``check_suite``   : repo, check_id, name, status, conclusion, head_sha

Design notes
------------
- The Flask endpoint validates the HMAC signature, idempotently records
  the delivery in ``webhook_deliveries`` and only then enqueues this
  task. By the time we run, the row exists with ``status='processing'``.
- We accept the body as a JSON string (not a dict) so Celery's JSON
  serializer doesn't have to round-trip nested objects, and so the
  Flask side can pass the byte-exact body without a re-serialize step.
- Each per-event handler runs the action AND marks
  ``webhook_deliveries.status='processed'`` inside a single DB
  transaction. On exception, the transaction rolls back, the dispatcher
  marks ``status='failed'`` (best-effort, separate connection), and
  re-raises so Celery's retry policy applies.
- Code-event handlers (Task 14) are pure structured-log emitters as
  the MVP — no bespoke event tables, no GitHub API calls. Each handler
  emits ONE INFO line tagged ``event_type=<name>`` so a future event-
  store work item can grep them. Missing payload fields render as
  ``<field>=<missing>`` rather than crashing the worker.
- We never log the full payload at INFO; only ``event_type``,
  ``action``, ``installation_id``, ``account_login`` and ``delivery_id``
  are safe identifiers.

Standard log keys
-----------------
This module emits structured ``key=value`` log lines on the canonical
key ``gh_webhook_handler``. The known handler values are:

    * ``dispatch``                    — entry / failure of the router itself.
    * ``installation``                — ``installation`` event handler.
    * ``installation_repositories``   — ``installation_repositories`` handler.
    * ``<event_type>``                — fall-through for not-yet-wired events.

Other keys present on these lines:

    * ``action``           — payload's ``action`` field, or ``-`` if absent.
    * ``installation_id``  — installation id from payload (when extracted).
    * ``account_login``    — installation account's login (when extracted).
    * ``delivery_id``      — ``X-GitHub-Delivery`` UUID (always present).
    * ``status``           — ``processed | failed | no_handler | invalid_json | ignored_unknown_action | noop_lazy_population``.
    * ``duration_ms``      — wall-clock for the handler body.
    * ``error_class``      — exception class name (failure paths only).
    * ``rows_deleted`` / ``rows_updated`` / ``repo_count`` — action-specific counters.

Token values are NEVER logged. Any exception text we include in the
``status=failed`` line is passed through ``redact_token()`` first.
