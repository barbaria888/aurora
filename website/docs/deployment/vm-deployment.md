# VM Deployment

Deploy Aurora on a single VM using Docker Compose. This guide covers every step from provisioning the VM to accessing Aurora in your browser, on any cloud provider.

## 1. Provision a VM

Create a VM on your cloud provider of choice (AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM, DigitalOcean Droplet, Hetzner, etc.).

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Debian 12 |
| **CPU** | 4 cores minimum, 8 recommended |
| **RAM** | 8 GB minimum, 32 GB recommended |
| **Disk** | **60 GB SSD** |

:::warning Disk Size
Aurora's Docker images, containers, and volumes require significant space.
:::

After creation, note the VM's **public/external IP address** — you'll need it later.

## 2. SSH Into the VM

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem YOUR_USERNAME@YOUR_VM_IP
```

Most cloud providers also offer a browser-based SSH console in their web UI.

## 3. Install Dependencies

Run these commands **one at a time** (not as a single pasted block — `newgrp` opens a sub-shell that prevents subsequent commands from running).

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
# Update packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install system tools
sudo apt install -y make git jq cloud-guest-utils

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply the group change (opens a new shell — run this separately)
newgrp docker

# Verify Docker works (must print v2.x.x)
docker compose version
```

### CentOS / RHEL / Amazon Linux

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y make git jq cloud-utils-growpart

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

docker compose version
```

If `docker` gives "permission denied" after `newgrp`, log out and back in (`exit` then SSH again).

:::caution Run Commands Individually
`newgrp docker` opens a new shell session. If you paste all commands at once, everything after `newgrp` will not execute in the current session. Run it separately, then continue with the remaining commands.
:::

## 4. Clone and Initialize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvo-ai/aurora.git
cd aurora
make init
```

`make init` creates `.env` from `.env.example` and generates random values for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, and `AUTH_SECRET`.

## 5. Configure .env

```bash
nano .env
```

### Required Changes

**LLM API Key** — set at least one (note that openAI and Gemini models are undergoing maintenance on our platform and are temporarily unavailable LLM providers.):

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...     # Recommended — one key, many models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**LLM Provider Mode** — must match whichever key you set (see [LLM_PROVIDER_MODE](/docs/configuration/environment#llm_provider_mode) for all options):

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER_MODE=openrouter   # for OPENROUTER_API_KEY (default)
LLM_PROVIDER_MODE=direct       # for direct provider keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
```

**VM URLs** — replace `YOUR_VM_IP` with your VM's public IP (or internal/VPN IP — see note below):

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://YOUR_VM_IP:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://YOUR_VM_IP:5080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://YOUR_VM_IP:5006
SEARXNG_URL=http://YOUR_VM_IP:8082
```

Leave `BACKEND_URL=http://aurora-server:5080` as-is — that's for internal container-to-container communication.

:::tip Private/Internal Network
If accessing via VPN, private subnet, or reverse proxy, use that IP/hostname instead of the public IP (e.g., `10.8.0.1` for a WireGuard tunnel, `192.168.x.x` for a private subnet, `https://aurora.internal` for a reverse proxy). `BACKEND_URL` always stays as the internal Docker name regardless.
:::

Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter` in nano).

:::tip Static IPs
Most cloud providers assign ephemeral public IPs by default — they change if you stop and restart the VM. Reserve a static/elastic IP through your provider's console so you only need to configure the URLs once.
:::

## 6. Build and Start

Choose one:

**Option A — Build from source** (recommended for most deployments):
```bash
make prod-local
```
Builds all Docker images from the cloned source code. Slower on first run (several minutes) but ensures you have the latest code and all connectors.

**Option B — Pull prebuilt images** (faster, but uses published releases):
```bash
make prod-prebuilt
```
Pulls prebuilt images from GHCR instead of building locally. Faster to start, but uses the last published release.

## 7. Get and Set the Vault Token

After the stack is running, the `vault-init` sidecar initializes Vault and generates a root token. Extract it and write it into `.env`:

```bash
# Wait ~30 seconds for vault-init to finish, then:
VAULT_TOKEN=$(docker exec aurora-vault cat /vault/init/keys.json | jq -r '.root_token') \
  && sed -i "s|^VAULT_TOKEN=.*|VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN|" .env

# Verify it was written
grep VAULT_TOKEN .env
```

If the command fails (container not ready yet), wait and retry. Check vault-init status with:

```bash
docker logs aurora-vault-init
```

## 8. Restart to Apply Vault Token

```bash
# Use whichever command you chose in step 6
make down && make prod-local      # if you built from source
make down && make prod-prebuilt   # if you pulled prebuilt images
```

## 9. Open Firewall Ports

Aurora needs three ports accessible from outside the VM:

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 3000 | Frontend (Next.js) |
| 5080 | Backend API (Flask) |
| 5006 | WebSocket (Chatbot) |

How you open these depends on your cloud provider:

**AWS** — Edit the instance's **Security Group**: add inbound rules for TCP 3000, 5080, 5006.

**GCP** — Create a **Firewall Rule** under VPC Network > Firewall: allow ingress TCP 3000, 5080, 5006.

**Azure** — Edit the **Network Security Group** attached to the VM: add inbound security rules for TCP 3000, 5080, 5006.

**DigitalOcean** — Create or edit a **Cloud Firewall** and add inbound rules for TCP 3000, 5080, 5006, then attach it to your droplet.

**Any provider** — Find the network firewall / security group attached to your VM and allow inbound TCP on ports 3000, 5080, and 5006.

For the source IP range, use your own IP (e.g., `1.2.3.4/32` — find it at [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/)) to restrict access to just you, or `0.0.0.0/0` for public access.

:::warning Security
Setting source to `0.0.0.0/0` makes the instance accessible to anyone on the internet. Aurora has its own login system, but for a test/internal deployment, restrict to your own IP for safety. Consider enabling rate limiting (`RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true` in `.env`) if exposing publicly.
:::

**OS-level firewall** — Most cloud VMs don't enable an OS-level firewall by default. If yours does (check with `sudo ufw status` or `sudo firewall-cmd --state`), also open the ports there:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (ufw)
sudo ufw allow 3000 && sudo ufw allow 5080 && sudo ufw allow 5006

# CentOS/RHEL (firewalld)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp --add-port=5080/tcp --add-port=5006/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## 10. Access Aurora

Open in your browser:

```
http://YOUR_VM_IP:3000
```

You must include the `:3000` port — plain `http://YOUR_VM_IP/` (port 80) will not work.

## Verify Health

```bash
# From inside the VM
curl http://localhost:5080/health/liveness

# Check all containers are running
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-local.yml ps
```

## Ongoing Operations

```bash
# View logs
make prod-logs

# Stop everything
make down

# Restart
make down && make prod-local

# Full cleanup (removes data volumes)
make prod-local-clean

# Nuclear option (removes everything including images)
make prod-local-nuke
```

## Deploying Code Updates

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull

# Rebuild and restart
make down && make prod-local
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are injected at container startup, not baked at build time. If you only change those values in `.env`, you can skip a full rebuild:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-local.yml up -d frontend
```

## Troubleshooting

### "no space left on device" During Build

The disk is full. Clean up and consider resizing:

```bash
docker image prune -a -f
docker builder prune -f
docker system df
```

If still not enough, resize the disk through your cloud provider's console and expand the partition:

```bash
sudo growpart /dev/sda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
```

### Vault Sealed After VM Restart

The `vault-init` sidecar auto-unseals on startup using keys stored in a persistent Docker volume. If it didn't work:

```bash
docker restart aurora-vault-init
```

### "Connection Timed Out" in Browser

1. Verify the cloud firewall / security group allows TCP 3000, 5080, 5006
2. Verify the OS-level firewall isn't blocking traffic (`sudo ufw status` or `sudo firewall-cmd --state`)
3. Verify you're using the correct public IP: `curl -s ifconfig.me`
4. Verify the frontend is running: `docker ps | grep frontend`

### Public IP Changed

Cloud provider ephemeral IPs change when the VM is stopped and restarted. Update `.env` with the new IP and recreate the frontend:

```bash
nano .env   # update FRONTEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL, SEARXNG_URL
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-local.yml up -d frontend
```

To avoid this, reserve a static/elastic IP through your cloud provider.

### Containers Keep Restarting

Check logs for the failing container:

```bash
docker logs aurora-server --tail 50
docker logs aurora-celery_worker-1 --tail 50
```

Common causes: missing env vars, Vault not ready, database not initialized.
